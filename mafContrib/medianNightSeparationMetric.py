    The mean separation between nights within a season, and then 
    the mean over the campaign. Intranight cadence is not so important

    to drive the precision of their measurement. We first list all 
    unique observing nights within a season, and then the mean differences 
    between consecutive observing nights. We have to do this season by 
    season to avoid counting the season gaps.
